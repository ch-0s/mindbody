Today's work is on trying to get serial mode implemented for the scanner. 

I will also do some dev work on the backend of the function if it seems like HID isolation is immediately possible, since I want to ensure that scanner can be isolated before attempting to move on to other parts of the codebase.

The guy came through. Gotta upload these for anyone else who's interested in this thing.

Alright so we can start on software-side dev. Since I can run the entire thin in the background I'm going to mostly just try to build a simple database that has FZF and autocompletion. 

I'm going to meet with Andy again to talk about specifics.
