Today's work is on trying to get serial mode implemented for the scanner. 

I will also do some dev work on the backend of the function if it seems like HID isolation is immediately possible, since I want to ensure that scanner can be isolated before attempting to move on to other parts of the codebase.

The guy came through. Gotta upload these for anyone else who's interested in this thing.
