5/2:
Finally got the manual to the scanner we're using. Will try to make some changes here as well as to the mindbody site.
https://www.symcode.cn/public/upload/MJ-340%20USER%20MANUAL%2088x140mm.pdf
barcode scanner changes:

add delay on scanning same barcode (5sec) x
remove delay for scanning new barcodes (min 0.5sec) x
always light on? x
mute buzzer 
boot prompt?
setup code prompt?
invoice function?

it was the wrong manual lol.
OK 

Finding the manual for this thing might actually be impossible.

Managed to get the usb data for the thing with ioreg.

7200@14400000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000d8019, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (711 ms), retain 16>
        {
          "sessionID" = 5009460323297167
          "iManufacturer" = 1
          "bNumConfigurations" = 1
          "idProduct" = 417
          "bcdDevice" = 64656
          "Bus Power Available" = 250
          "USB Address" = 5

          "USB Serial Number" = "C71172N0004"
          "IOClassNameOverride" = "IOUSBDevice"
        }

on the manual front, I found a guy on facebook who might be affiliated with the company that makes these, so I've just sent him a DM on whatsapp.
This is a bit ridiculous but if I get the manual I won't complain.

I'm going to conclude my work for today, but I'm a bit frustrated that nothing really panned out.
Next time I will probably just try to capture the HID device.
