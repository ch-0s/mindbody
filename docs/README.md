The Mindbody project is comprised of several independent (or semi-independent) parts.

The serial listener reads the inputs from the scanner and writes it to a buffer.

The database (and the database getter) maintain minimal mirrors of the VIM Fitness client database locally, and tracks towel checkouts.

The check-in interface makes a sound and changes color to indicate the status of each user checking in. 

The towel inteface provides tools to quickly create towel entries.

The documentation for each is continued in respective files.
